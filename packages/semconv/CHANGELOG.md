# @harnessforce/semconv

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7506e88: Follow the retirement of Plan, Decision, Definition of Done, native Issue creation and usage limits in Harnessforce. The `record-run` skill only starts and completes a Run, and no longer calls `record_plan`, `record_action`, `record_definition_of_done_items` or `create_issue`. `harnessforce usage-limits` and `/harnessforce:usage-limits` are removed, and `/harnessforce:setup` no longer offers to share usage limits. `@harnessforce/semconv` drops the `hf.cycle.id` attribute. If you ran `harnessforce usage-limits on` earlier, restore the `statusLine` in your Claude Code user settings by hand.
